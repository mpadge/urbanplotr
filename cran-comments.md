# CRAN notes for osmplotr_v0.3.6 re-submission

This is a re-submission of a previously archived package. The submission may
generate one single note regarding installed size of ~6MB, which is due to the
vignettes. These produce many graphical files illustrating the package's
functionality. Every effort has been made to reduce this as much as possible,
including reducing the resolution of these images to the coarsest practicable
scale. Halving the resolution again (from current 72 to 36 dpi) only decreases
the final package size by around 200 kB.

## Test environments

Other than the above, this submission generates NO notes on:

- Linux (via github actions): R-release, R-oldrelease
- Windows (via github actions): R-release, R-oldrelease, R-devel
- win-builder: R-oldrelease, R-release, R-devel
