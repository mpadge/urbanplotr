\usage{
osm_line2poly(obj, bbox)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A Simple Features (\code{sf}) data frame of lines, typically as
returned by \code{\link{extract_osm_objects}}, or by
\code{osmdata::osmdata_sf}.}

\item{bbox}{bounding box (Latitude-longitude range) to be plotted.  A 2-by-2
matrix of 4 elements with columns of min and max values, and rows of x and y
values. Can also be an object of class \code{sf}, for example as returned
from \code{extract_osm_objects} or the \code{osmdata} package, in which case
the bounding box will be extracted from the object coordinates.}
}
\value{
A list of three Simple Features (\code{sf}) data frames, labelled sea
islands and land.
}
\description{
Converts \code{sf::sfc_LINSTRING} objects to polygons by connecting end
points around the given bounding box. This is particularly useful for
plotting water and land delineated by coastlines. Coastlines in OpenStreetMap
are lines, not polygons, and so there is no directly way to plot ocean water
distinct from land. This function enables that by connecting the end points
of coastline \code{LINESTRING} objects to form closed polygons.
}
\details{
This is a tricky problem for a number of reasons, and the current
implementation may not be correct, although it does successfully deal with a
few tough situations. Some of the issues are: an osm coastline query returns
a mixture of "ways" and polygons.

Polygons correspond to islands, but not all islands are polygons. A "way" is
a connected set of points with the land on the left. A piece of coastline in
a bounding box may consist of multiple ways, which need to be connected
together to create a polygon. Also, ways extend outside the query bounding
box, and may join other ways that enter the bounding box (e.g ends of a
peninsula). The degree to which this happens depends on the scale of the
bounding box. Coastlines may enter at any bounding box edge and exit at any
other, including the one they entered from.

coast <- osm_line2poly (coast, bbox = bb)
# The following map then colours in just the ocean:
map <- osm_basemap (bbox = bb) \%>\%
    add_osm_objects (coast$sea, col = "lightsteelblue") \%>\%
    print_osm_map ()
