\title{connect_highways}
\usage{
connect_highways(highways, bbox, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{highways}{A vector of highway names passed directly to the Overpass
API. Wildcards and whitespaces are `.'; for other options see online help for
the overpass API.}

\item{bbox}{the bounding box for the map.  A 2-by-2 matrix of 4 elements with
columns of min and max values, and rows of x and y values.}

\item{plot}{If \code{TRUE}, then all OSM data for each highway is plotted and
the final cycle overlaid.}
}
\value{
A single set of \code{SpatialPoints} containing the lat-lon
coordinates of the cyclic line connecting all given streets.
}
\description{
Takes a list of highways names which must enclose an internal area, and
returns a \code{SpatialLines} object containing a sequence of OSM nodes which
cyclically connect all highways. Will fail if the streets do not form a
cycle.
}
\note{
\enumerate{
\item \code{connect_highways} is primarily intended to provide a means to
define boundaries of groups which can then be highlighted using
\code{\link{add_osm_groups}}.
\item This function can not be guaranteed failsafe owing both to the
inherently unpredictable nature of OpenStreetMap, as well as to the unknown
relationships between named highways. The \code{plot} option enables
problematic cases to be examined and hopefully resolved.  The function is
still experimental, so please help further improvements by reporting any
problems!
