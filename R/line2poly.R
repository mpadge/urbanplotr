#' osm_line2poly
#'
#' Converts \code{sf::sfc_LINSTRING} objects to polygons by connecting end
#' points around the given bounding box. This is particularly useful for
#' plotting water and land delineated by coastlines. Coastlines in OpenStreetMap
#' are lines, not polygons, and so there is no directly way to plot ocean water
#' distinct from land. This function enables that by connecting the end points
#' of coastline \code{LINESTRING} objects to form closed polygons.
#'
#' This is a tricky problem for a number of reasons, and the current
#' implementation may not be correct, although it does successfully deal with a
#' few tough situations. Some of the issues are: an osm coastline query returns
#' a mixture of "ways" and polygons.
#'
#' Polygons correspond to islands, but not all islands are polygons. A "way" is
#' a connected set of points with the land on the left. A piece of coastline in
#' a bounding box may consist of multiple ways, which need to be connected
#' together to create a polygon. Also, ways extend outside the query bounding
#' box, and may join other ways that enter the bounding box (e.g ends of a
#' peninsula). The degree to which this happens depends on the scale of the
#' bounding box. Coastlines may enter at any bounding box edge and exit at any
#' other, including the one they entered from.
#'
#' @param obj A Simple Features (\code{sf}) data frame of lines, typically as
#' returned by \code{\link{extract_osm_objects}}, or by
#' \code{osmdata::osmdata_sf}.
#' @param bbox bounding box (Latitude-longitude range) to be plotted.  A 2-by-2
#' matrix of 4 elements with columns of min and max values, and rows of x and y
#' values. Can also be an object of class \code{sf}, for example as returned
#' from \code{extract_osm_objects} or the \code{osmdata} package, in which case
#' the bounding box will be extracted from the object coordinates.
#' @return A list of three Simple Features (\code{sf}) data frames, labelled sea
#' islands and land.
